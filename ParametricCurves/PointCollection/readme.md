# Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to collect the points via a pair of BSTs (Binary Search Trees): one for the x-coordinate, and one for the y-coordinate. But a reference for each of the BSTs refer to the same point.

This is an efficiency approach that I may consider in the future. For now, we'll keep things strictly simple.
